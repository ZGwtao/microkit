- elf file has different segments with different perms but microkit sdf always has the MR has rwx perms
- can not actually break channel between two PDs because we can only remove the output notification cap =>
    - gernot says there should be a way to disable a channel from one end by masking or somehting?

todo:
- signing just access rights section, have private key to sign it passed into the script and then public key passed to the tool because
the intention is for the ELF file to be a normal ELF file able to run by other ppl, if the whole ELF file was signed it would become
nonstandard, also the hash is just for a check and it should be alongside the actual access rights, so the xoring of the three
components is fine. the trusted loader gets the public key patched. alternatively pass in the key as the ppc?
- change design to take in elf file in shared memory region and reset on ppc call
- implement the virts design as outlined by gernot
